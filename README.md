#iPhone SMS dump tool#
This tool is used to dump sms messages from an iPhone backup. Messages are saved as text files named after the address of the person you communicated with.

##Current Status##
I have no regular access to an iPhone so I only tested this once using an iPhone running IOS 3.1.2 and iTunes version 11.1.1.

##Usage##
Options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -d DB_FILE, --db=DB_FILE
	                        SMS DB File [default: 3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28.mddata]
